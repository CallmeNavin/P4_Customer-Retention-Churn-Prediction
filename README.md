**Telco Customer Churn Prediction**

**VERSION 1**

**A. Project Overview**

- This project predicts the likelihood of customer churn based on transaction and contract information, in order to support effective retention strategies.

**B. Dataset Information**

- Source: Kaggle ‚Äì WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv
- Churn rate: 26.6% churn vs. 73.4% retained ‚Üí imbalanced dataset

**C. Methodology**

- Basic EDA: shape, info, isnull, describe
- Converted TotalCharges from object ‚Üí numeric & handled 11 missing values by fill = 0
- Applied one-hot encoding for categorical variables (drop_first=True)
- Dropped customerID as it has no predictive value.
- Standardized numeric variables prior to model training.

**D. Key Findings & Actionable Plans**

_**Modeling Strategy**_

- If the goal is to capture as many churn cases as possible (high Recall) ‚Üí Logistic Regression tuned (Recall ‚âà 79.7%).
- If the goal is to balance Precision and Recall ‚Üí Random Forest tuned (F1 = 0.6323, highest ROC-AUC).

_**Key Findings**_

- High monthly charges and Fiber optic internet users show higher churn risk.
- Two-year contracts and longer tenure are strong retention drivers.
- Customers using Electronic check payments should be investigated further for pain points in their payment experience.

**VERSION 2**

**A. Project Overview**

- This project predicts the likelihood of customer churn based on transaction and contract information, in order to support effective retention strategies.

**B. Methodology**

- Check outliers: For 03 numeric columns --> 0% outliers
- Predictive Analysis:
  + Define target columns (y): churn
    - One-hot encoding: to int
  + Prepare input columns (x): Other columns, except customerID
    - Comprehensive One-hot encoding:
      + For 06 Binary columns - by maps: to int
      + For 10 Category columns - by get_dummies: to bool
    - Drop customerID columns cause it has no predictive value
- Preparation for modelling
  + Define x, y
  + Train Split Test
- Modeling (l·∫ßn n√†y kh√¥ng tune + More chart: Heatmap, Boxplot for more visual):
  + Logistics Regression
  + Random Forest Classifier

**C. Model Evaluation, Key Findings & Actionable Plans**

**I. Logistics Regression**

**_I.1. Model Evaluation_**

- Accuracy Score: 0.72 ‚Üí Good
- Precision Score: 0.48 ‚Üí Too low, below the average range (0.5). Many false positives.
- Recall Score: 0.83 ‚Üí High, few churn cases missed.
- F1 Score: 0.61 ‚Üí Moderate, showing imbalance between Precision and Recall.
- ROC AUC Score: 0.83 ‚Üí Good model performance in distinguishing churn vs. non-churn.
- Confusion Matrix:

**_I.2. Key Findings_**

- The model performs well in distinguishing churn vs. non-churn (AUC = 0.83).
  + High Recall (0.83) means the model captures most churn cases.
  + Low Precision (0.48) indicates many false positives (non-churn customers misclassified as churn).

‚Üí Trade-off: catching all churn cases requires accepting lower Precision, and vice versa. 

‚Üí The model is effective in identifying churn, but it leans toward maximizing Recall at the expense of Precision. This makes it suitable for businesses that prioritize retaining true churn customers, even if it means contacting many non-churn customers unnecessarily.

**_I.3. Actionable Plans_**

- Adjust decision threshold by different thresholds (e.g. 0.3, 0.4, 0.6) to balance Precision and Recall according to business priorities.

**II. Random Forest Classifier**
