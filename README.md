**Telco Customer Churn Prediction**

**A. Project Overview**

- This project predicts the likelihood of customer churn based on transaction and contract information, in order to support effective retention strategies.

**B. Dataset Information**

- Source: Kaggle ‚Äì WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv
- Churn rate: 26.6% churn vs. 73.4% retained ‚Üí imbalanced dataset

**C. Methodology**

- Converted TotalCharges from object ‚Üí float, handled 11 missing values.
- Applied one-hot encoding for categorical variables (drop_first=True).
- Dropped customerID as it has no predictive value.
- Standardized numeric variables prior to model training.

**D. Key Findings & Actionable Plans**

_**Modeling Strategy**_

- If the goal is to capture as many churn cases as possible (high Recall) ‚Üí Logistic Regression tuned (Recall ‚âà 79.7%).
- If the goal is to balance Precision and Recall ‚Üí Random Forest tuned (F1 = 0.6323, highest ROC-AUC).

_**Key Findings**_

- High monthly charges and Fiber optic internet users show higher churn risk.
- Two-year contracts and longer tenure are strong retention drivers.
- Customers using Electronic check payments should be investigated further for pain points in their payment experience.

_**Actionable Plans**_
