**Telco Customer Churn Prediction**

**VERSION 1**

**A. Project Overview**

- This project predicts the likelihood of customer churn based on transaction and contract information, in order to support effective retention strategies.

**B. Dataset Information**

- Source: Kaggle ‚Äì WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv
- Churn rate: 26.6% churn vs. 73.4% retained ‚Üí imbalanced dataset

**C. Methodology**

- Basic EDA: shape, info, isnull, describe
- Converted TotalCharges from object ‚Üí numeric & handled 11 missing values by fill = 0
- Applied one-hot encoding for categorical variables (drop_first=True)
- Dropped customerID as it has no predictive value.
- Standardized numeric variables prior to model training.

**D. Key Findings & Actionable Plans**

_**Modeling Strategy**_

- If the goal is to capture as many churn cases as possible (high Recall) ‚Üí Logistic Regression tuned (Recall ‚âà 79.7%).
- If the goal is to balance Precision and Recall ‚Üí Random Forest tuned (F1 = 0.6323, highest ROC-AUC).

_**Key Findings**_

- High monthly charges and Fiber optic internet users show higher churn risk.
- Two-year contracts and longer tenure are strong retention drivers.
- Customers using Electronic check payments should be investigated further for pain points in their payment experience.

| TotalCharges   | -0.199 | Lower accumulated payments ‚Üí more likely to churn |
| MonthlyCharges | +0.193 | Higher monthly fees ‚Üí more likely to churn        |

**VERSION 2**

**A. Project Overview**

- This project predicts the likelihood of customer churn based on transaction and contract information, in order to support effective retention strategies.

**B. Methodology**

- Check outliers: For 03 numeric columns --> 0% outliers
- Predictive Analysis:
  + Define target columns (y): churn
    - One-hot encoding: to int
  + Prepare input columns (x): Other columns, except customerID
    - Comprehensive One-hot encoding:
      + For 06 Binary columns - by maps: to int
      + For 10 Category columns - by get_dummies: to bool
    - Drop customerID columns cause it has no predictive value
  + Train Split Test
  + Modeling
  + Model Evaluation (More chart: Heatmap, Boxplot for more visual)
